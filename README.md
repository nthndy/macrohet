A repo for bringing together all of the threads of my analyses for studying the single cell heterogeneity of human macrophages infected with _Mycobacterium Tuberculosis_ (Mtb).

WORK IN PROGRESS

Currently mainly using it to back up various messy notebooks etc.

### This repository has 2 main aspects to it: labelling and analysis

1. The upstream labelling section is for the tiling, segmentation and tracking of timelapse microscopy data of human macrophages infected with _Mycobacterium Tuberculosis_.
2. The downstream analysis section is for investigating and interrogating the tracks created in the first section as well as any biological analysis of the microscopy data.

Both sections contain `dev` folders where the bulk of the WIP notebooks will be located. The more generally applicable and polished notebooks will be in the main directories of each section.
